All exercises here concern the Music database.  You'll find the table structures in "The Music Database" are a useful reference, 
or you can practice using SHOW statements as your work your way through the tasks

1. Use one or more SELECT statements to find out how many tracks are on New Order's "Brotherhood" album

2. Using a join, list the albums that we own by the band New Order

3. With INSERT statements, add the artist "Leftfield" to the database. For this new artist, add the album "Leftism" that has the following tracks
	a. Release the Pressure (Time: 7.39)
	b. Afro-Melt (Time (7.33)
	c Melt (Time: 7.33)
	d. Song of Life (Time: 6.55)
	e. Original (Time: 6.00)
	f. Black Flute (Time: 3.46)
	g. Space Shanty (Time: 7.15)
	h. Inspection Check One (Time: 6.30)
	i. Storm 3000 (Time: 5.44)
	j. Open Up (Time: 6.52)
	k. 21st Century Pown (Time: 5.42)
	l. Bonus Track (Time: 1.22)
