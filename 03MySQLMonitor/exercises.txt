1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?
	- Clients connect to the server to perform operations.  Multiple clients are available

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)
	- in Monitor, "help select"

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?
	- Interactive mode allows you to type SQL queries or MySQL commands at the command prompt and see the response
	- Batch mode you tell the monitor to read in & execute commands from a file.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?
	 - user (--user/-u) - username to use when connecting to the mysql server.  If not provided, will default to machine account name
	 - password (--password/-p) - Password for the above user.  Will prompt for password if none provided
	 - database (--database/-D) - tells which database to use.  Can also omit -database/-D and put the database to use at end of mysql command
